# Flexily Internals

Read this before modifying any source file. This documents the layout algorithm, zero-allocation design, caching system, and integration points.

## Architecture Overview

Flexily is a pure-JavaScript flexbox layout engine with a Yoga-compatible API. The "zero" in `layout-zero.ts` / `node-zero.ts` means **zero-allocation layout** -- the layout pass reuses pre-allocated structures instead of creating temporary objects on the heap.

- Yoga-compatible API surface: same method names, same constants, drop-in replacement
- Pure JavaScript: no WASM, no native dependencies, synchronous initialization
- Module-level pre-allocated arrays with save/restore for re-entrancy (measureFunc/baselineFunc may call calculateLayout on other trees)

## Layout Algorithm Phases

`layoutNode()` in `layout-zero.ts` implements CSS Flexbox Section 9.7. It is called recursively for each node. The algorithm has 11 phases:

### Phase 1: Early Exit Checks

- `display: none` -> zero-size return
- **Constraint fingerprinting**: If `layoutValid && !isDirty && same(availW, availH, dir)`, skip layout entirely. Only update position delta if offset changed. This is the core of the 5.5x re-layout speedup.

### Phase 2: Resolve Spacing

- Resolve margins, padding, borders from `Value` (point/percent/auto) to absolute numbers
- CSS spec: percentage margins AND padding resolve against containing block's **width only**
- Logical edges (START/END) resolve based on `direction` (LTR/RTL)

### Phase 3: Calculate Node Dimensions

- Resolve width/height from style (point, percent, or auto/NaN)
- Apply aspect ratio constraint
- Apply min/max constraints
- Compute content area (inside border+padding)
- Compute position offsets for relative/static children

### Phase 4: Handle Leaf Nodes

Two cases:

- **With measureFunc**: Call `cachedMeasure()` to get intrinsic size (text nodes)
- **Without measureFunc**: Intrinsic size = padding + border (empty boxes)

### Phase 5: Collect Children and Compute Base Sizes

Single pass over children:

- Skip `display:none` and `position:absolute` (set `relativeIndex = -1`)
- Cache all 4 resolved margins on `child.flex`
- Compute base size from: `flexBasis` > explicit `width`/`height` > `measureFunc` > recursive `measureNode` > padding+border
- Track flex factors, min/max, auto margins
- **CSS 4.5 divergence**: For `overflow:hidden/scroll`, force `flexShrink >= 1` (Yoga doesn't do this)

### Phase 6a: Line Breaking and Space Distribution

- `breakIntoLines()` splits children into flex lines (for wrap)
- `distributeFlexSpaceForLine()` implements CSS 9.7 iterative freeze algorithm:
  - Positive free space -> grow (distribute by `flexGrow` ratio)
  - Negative free space -> shrink (distribute by `flexShrink * baseSize` ratio -- weighted shrink)
  - Items that hit min/max are "frozen"; iteration continues with remaining items
  - Single-child fast path skips iteration

### Phase 6b: Justify-Content and Auto Margins (Per Line)

- Auto margins absorb space BEFORE `justifyContent` (CSS spec)
- Per-line calculation for multi-line (flex-wrap) layouts
- Space-between/around/evenly only apply with positive remaining space

### Phase 6c: Baseline Alignment

- Pre-compute baselines for `align-items: baseline` (row direction only)
- Uses `baselineFunc` if set, otherwise falls back to bottom of content box

### Phase 7a: Estimate Line Cross Sizes

- Tentative cross-axis sizes from definite child dimensions
- For measureFunc children: uses `child.flex.mainSize` (from flex distribution), not parent `mainAxisSize`. This ensures text wrapping is measured at the child's actual constrained width.
- Auto-sized children use 0 (actual size computed in Phase 8)

### Phase 7b: Apply alignContent

- Distribute flex lines within the cross-axis (stretch, center, space-between, etc.)
- Yoga quirk: `ALIGN_STRETCH` applies even to single-line layouts

### Phase 8: Position and Layout Children

The most complex phase. For each relative child:

1. Determine cross-axis alignment (alignItems/alignSelf)
2. Resolve cross-axis size (explicit, percent, stretch, or shrink-wrap/NaN)
3. Handle measure function for intrinsic sizing
4. Compute fractional position (main-axis from `mainPos`, cross-axis from `lineCrossOffset`)
5. **Edge-based rounding** (Yoga-compatible): Round absolute edges, derive sizes as `round(end) - round(start)`. This prevents pixel gaps between adjacent elements.
6. Recursively call `layoutNode()` for grandchildren
7. Override sizes based on flex distribution results
8. Apply cross-axis alignment offset (flex-end, center, baseline)
9. Advance `mainPos` for next child

### Phase 9b: Re-stretch Auto-Sized Cross Axis

- When cross axis was auto (NaN) during Phase 8, `ALIGN_STRETCH` children need re-stretching to the now-known cross size

### Phase 9c: Re-align Auto-Sized Cross Axis

- When `crossAxisSize` was NaN during Phase 8, alignment offsets for `ALIGN_CENTER`, `ALIGN_FLEX_END`, and cross-axis auto margins computed NaN. Phase 9c recomputes these using the final shrink-wrapped cross size.

### Phase 9: Shrink-Wrap Auto-Sized Containers

- For containers without explicit size, compute actual used space from children
- Main axis: sum of child sizes + margins + gaps
- Cross axis: max child size + margins

### Phase 10: Final Output

- Edge-based rounding for the node itself
- Position stored as relative (to parent), not absolute

### Phase 11: Layout Absolute Children

- Absolute children positioned relative to padding box (not content box)
- Support for left/right/top/bottom offsets
- Auto margins for centering
- Alignment when no position is set

## Zero-Allocation Design

### Why It Matters

Interactive TUIs re-layout on every keystroke. GC pauses cause visible jank. Flexily avoids heap allocation during layout passes.

### Module-Level Pre-Allocated Arrays

```typescript
// Used for flex-wrap multi-line layouts (layout-zero.ts)
let _lineCrossSizes = new Float64Array(32) // Cross-axis size per line
let _lineCrossOffsets = new Float64Array(32) // Cross-axis offset per line
let _lineLengths = new Uint16Array(32) // Children per line
let _lineChildren: Node[][] = Array(32) // Node refs per line
let _lineJustifyStarts = new Float64Array(32) // Per-line justify start
let _lineItemSpacings = new Float64Array(32) // Per-line item spacing
```

These grow dynamically if >32 lines (rare). Total memory: ~1,344 bytes (4 Float64Arrays × 256 bytes + 1 Uint16Array × 64 bytes + Array overhead).

**Re-entrancy**: A `measureFunc` or `baselineFunc` may synchronously call `calculateLayout()` on a separate tree. `enterLayout()`/`exitLayout()` in `layout-flex-lines.ts` bracket nested calls to save and restore the module-level scratch arrays, preventing corruption of the outer pass's state. Only allocates on re-entrant calls (depth > 0).

### Per-Node FlexInfo (`node.flex`)

Instead of creating `ChildLayout` objects per child per pass, intermediate layout state is stored directly on each node in the `_flex: FlexInfo` field. This struct is mutated in place each pass:

```typescript
interface FlexInfo {
  // Flex distribution state (mutated during Phase 5-6)
  mainSize
  baseSize
  mainMargin
  flexGrow
  flexShrink
  minMain
  maxMain
  frozen
  mainStartMarginAuto
  mainEndMarginAuto
  mainStartMarginValue
  mainEndMarginValue
  marginL
  marginT
  marginR
  marginB
  lineIndex
  relativeIndex
  baseline

  // Constraint fingerprinting (mutated at end of layoutNode)
  lastAvailW
  lastAvailH
  lastOffsetX
  lastOffsetY
  lastAbsX
  lastAbsY
  lastDir
  layoutValid
}
```

### Shared Traversal Stack

```typescript
// utils.ts - single pre-allocated stack for all iterative traversals
export const traversalStack: unknown[] = []
```

Used by `markSubtreeLayoutSeen`, `countNodes`, `resetLayoutCache`, `propagatePositionDelta`. Avoids recursion (prevents stack overflow on deep trees) and avoids per-traversal allocation.

### Measure Cache (Per-Node)

4-entry numeric cache on each Node (`_m0` through `_m3`), avoiding Map/object allocations:

```typescript
interface MeasureEntry {
  w
  wm
  h
  hm
  rw
  rh
}
```

Returns a stable `_measureResult` object (mutated in place) to avoid allocation on cache hits. Cache is cleared on `markDirty()`.

### Layout Cache (Per-Node)

2-entry cache (`_lc0`, `_lc1`) for sizing passes. Stores `availW, availH -> computedW, computedH`. Cleared at start of each `calculateLayout()` pass. Returns a stable `_layoutResult` object. Uses `-1` as invalidation sentinel (not `NaN`, because `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` is true and would cause false hits).

## Caching and Dirty Tracking

### Dirty Propagation

`markDirty()` propagates up to root:

1. Clears measure cache (`_m0-_m3`) and layout cache (`_lc0-_lc1`) on every ancestor
2. Sets `_isDirty = true`
3. Invalidates `flex.layoutValid`
4. Stops early if an ancestor is already dirty (caches still cleared)

**Subtlety**: Even if a node is already dirty, child changes may invalidate cached layout results that used the old child size. That's why caches are always cleared, even when `_isDirty` is already true.

### Constraint Fingerprinting

The core re-layout optimization. At the end of `layoutNode()`, fingerprint values are stored:

```typescript
flex.lastAvailW = availableWidth
flex.lastAvailH = availableHeight
flex.lastOffsetX = offsetX
flex.lastOffsetY = offsetY
flex.lastAbsX = absX
flex.lastAbsY = absY
flex.lastDir = direction
flex.layoutValid = true
```

On next call, if `layoutValid && !isDirty && same constraints`, the entire subtree is skipped. Only position delta is propagated (if offset changed).

**`absX`/`absY` must be fingerprinted** because edge-based rounding depends on absolute position: `width = round(absX + nodeWidth) - round(absX)`. A fractional shift in absX (e.g., from a sibling's width change) changes the rounded result even when availW/availH/direction are unchanged.

**`Object.is()` is required** for NaN-safe comparison. `NaN === NaN` is `false`; `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` is `true`. NaN represents "unconstrained" -- a legitimate and common constraint value.

### Invalidation Triggers

`layoutValid` is set to `false` when:

- `markDirty()` is called (style change, content change)
- A sibling is inserted/removed (positions change)

### `calculateLayout()` Top-Level Skip

The root node also has a constraint-based skip:

```typescript
if (!this._isDirty && same(_lastCalcW, availW) && same(_lastCalcH, availH) && _lastCalcDir === dir) return // No layout needed at all
```

This makes the no-change case ~27ns (a simple comparison, not even entering the algorithm).

## Edge-Based Rounding (Yoga-Compatible)

**Problem**: Naive `Math.round(width)` creates pixel gaps between adjacent elements. If child1 has `width=10.5` and child2 starts at `x=10.5`, rounding each independently gives `width=11` and `x=11` -- 0.5px gap.

**Solution**: Round **absolute edge positions**, then derive sizes as differences:

```typescript
const absLeft = Math.round(absX + marginLeft + fractionalLeft)
const absRight = Math.round(absX + marginLeft + fractionalLeft + childWidth)
child.layout.width = absRight - absLeft // Always gap-free
```

This is Yoga's algorithm. Layout positions stored in `layout.left`/`layout.top` are **relative** to parent.

## measureNode vs layoutNode

`measureNode()` (~260 lines) is a lightweight alternative to `layoutNode()` (~1900 lines). It computes `width` and `height` but NOT `left`/`top`. Used during Phase 5 for intrinsic sizing of auto-sized container children. Save/restore of `layout.width`/`layout.height` is required around `measureNode` calls because it overwrites those fields.

## Integration: How Silvery Uses Flexily

Silvery uses Flexily through an adapter layer:

1. `silvery/src/layout-engine.ts` defines the `LayoutEngine` / `LayoutNode` interfaces
2. `silvery/src/adapters/flexily-zero-adapter.ts` wraps `Node` in `FlexilyZeroNodeAdapter`
3. The adapter is mostly delegation (Flexily already has a Yoga-compatible API)
4. Measure modes are translated from numeric constants to strings (`"exactly"`, `"at-most"`, `"undefined"`)

silvery calls `calculateLayout()` on every render. The no-change case (cursor movement, selection) is the most common scenario in the km TUI, which is why the 5.5x fingerprint-cache advantage matters.

## Intentional Divergences from Yoga

| Behavior                                  | Yoga                                     | Flexily                                    | CSS Spec                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `overflow:hidden/scroll` + `flexShrink:0` | Item expands to content (ignores parent) | Item shrinks to fit parent                 | 4.5: auto min-size = 0 for overflow containers                 |
| Default `flexShrink`                      | 0 (Yoga native default)                  | Preset: 0 (yoga) or 1 (css)                | CSS default is 1                                               |
| Default `alignContent`                    | flex-start                               | Preset: flex-start (yoga) or stretch (css) | stretch                                                        |
| Default `flexDirection`                   | Column                                   | Row (CSS default)                          | Row                                                            |
| Baseline alignment                        | Full spec (recursive first-child)        | Simplified (no recursive propagation)      | Recursive first-child                                          |
| **Flex-item default min-size**            | `0` (no auto floor)                      | CSS preset: content-based min; Yoga: `0`   | §4.5 item rule: `min-block-size: auto = content-based minimum` |

`measureFunc` leaf main-axis position is deliberately absent from this table — it is a quantization-policy difference, not a semantic divergence. See below.

The `flexShrink` override for overflow containers (line ~1244 in layout-zero.ts) is the most significant _container-side_ divergence. Without it, `overflow:hidden` children inside constrained parents balloon to content size, defeating the purpose of clipping.

### The two-level contract: semantics vs quantization

**This is NOT a semantic divergence, and reading it as one is the mistake this section prevents.** The contract has two levels:

1. **Continuous space → Yoga semantics.** Certified by the 20533 Yoga-oracle differential over 1728 `measureFunc`-leaf shapes, and still true. The Yoga differential fuzz (451 cases) guards it.
2. **Quantization to a discrete grid → target-specific policy.** The cell-grid policy's invariant is exact tiling: edge-based rounding only tiles if each shared edge is rounded by exactly ONE function.

Yoga's `floor`-position / `ceil`-right-edge for text is a _subpixel quantization policy_, not semantics.

**Both policies optimize the same value — never silently lose content.** At subpixel scale, loss means clipping a glyph, so Yoga eats an invisible overlap with the neighbour to prevent it. On a cell grid the overlap IS the loss: a whole cell the later sibling paints over, and for elided text that cell is the one holding the "…", so content vanishes with no marker. Same principle, target-inverted policy — which is why the multi-target story needs no exception list (canvas/DOM takes continuous values or Yoga's subpixel policy; the terminal takes tiling).

Flexily therefore gives `measureFunc` leaves the same telescoping main-axis position as every other child (`roundedAbsMainStart - roundedAbsParentMainStart`); the cross-axis leaf `Math.floor` is unaffected, as is the Ink center behavior that depends on it. The failure mode is non-monotonic in container width — which children sit past the 0.5 boundary shifts as flex redistributes a deficit — so it is guarded by a width SWEEP (`tests/main-axis-tiling.test.ts`), never by a hand-picked width.

**Restoring Yoga's text rounding here does not restore fidelity** — level 1 is already intact. Check the differential fuzz before changing level 2.

**`classic/` has NOT adopted the tiling policy, and that limits what it can adjudicate.** It still rounds a child's position with a local `Math.round` of the fractional offset (`classic/layout.ts`) while sizing by absolute edges — two functions for one shared edge — so it does not tile measure leaves the way `zero` now does. **classic is therefore not a reference for QUANTIZATION questions; it remains a reference for allocation behaviour.** If you are debugging a tiling or rounding disagreement, do not treat classic's answer as the oracle: the two are expected to differ at level 2. Whether classic should adopt the policy or be documented as deliberately Yoga-shaped is an open decision — the invariant actually worth testing is that classic and zero agree at LEVEL 1, on pre-quantization continuous values, which is what makes classic a reference at all and which nothing currently checks.

### Flex-item auto min-size (CSS §4.5, item-side rule — shipped under CSS preset)

CSS §4.5 has two complementary rules: the _container_ side (overflow containers get `min-size: auto = 0`, implemented around layout-zero.ts:587) and the _item_ side (flex items default to `min-block-size: auto = content-based minimum`).

Both are now implemented. The item-side rule lives at layout-zero.ts in the `Min/max on main axis` block (search for `UNIT_AUTO`):

```typescript
if (minVal.unit === C.UNIT_AUTO) {
  let autoMin = childStyle.overflow === C.OVERFLOW_VISIBLE ? baseSize : 0
  // Clamp by definite max-* (CSS specified-size suggestion bounded by max-*).
  if (maxVal.unit === C.UNIT_POINT || maxVal.unit === C.UNIT_PERCENT) {
    const maxResolved = resolveValue(maxVal, mainAxisSize)
    if (!Number.isNaN(maxResolved) && maxResolved !== Infinity) {
      autoMin = Math.min(autoMin, maxResolved)
    }
  }
  cflex.minMain = autoMin
}
```

Gating: CSS preset's `createDefaultStyle("css")` sets `minWidth`/`minHeight` to `UNIT_AUTO`. Yoga preset leaves them as `UNIT_UNDEFINED` → fall-through to `cflex.minMain = 0` (legacy behavior). Both presets share the explicit-value path.

### Implementation note: `contentMinSize` (handles `flex: 1 1 0`)

When flex-basis is auto, baseSize equals content size and works directly as
the auto-min content proxy. When flex-basis is definite (e.g. `flex: 1 1 0`
where flex-basis = 0), baseSize comes from flex-basis, NOT content. Auto-min
needs content size in both cases.

Solution: track `contentMinSize` separately from `baseSize`. Computed only
when auto-min applies (gating: `minVal.unit === UNIT_AUTO` + visible overflow

- not fit-content), so the extra measureFunc call is skipped in the common
  case. For measureFunc nodes with definite flex-basis, the same `cachedMeasure`
  call as the flex-basis-auto path re-derives content; the cache amortizes
  when both calls land on the same args.

### Recursive intrinsic min-content for `contentMinSize`

Every `Node` exposes `getMinContent(direction, containingBlockSize?)` — its
intrinsic CSS min-content along a given axis, computed recursively from
its content. `layout-zero.ts` queries the child uniformly when deriving
the auto-min-size for a flex item: no parent-side branching on
measureFunc / has-children / empty-leaf.

The recursive walk:

- **Leaf with measureFunc**: query measurer with `MEASURE_MODE_MIN_CONTENT`
  along the requested axis (spec-correct CSS min-content — longest
  unbreakable word for wrappable text; `naturalWidth` for non-wrappable).
- **Container, main axis** (`direction == flexDirection`):
  `padding + border + sum(child.getMinContent(direction)) + total gap`
- **Container, cross axis** (`direction != flexDirection`):
  `padding + border + max(child.getMinContent(direction))`
- **Empty leaf without measureFunc**: `padding + border`.

The recursive call from a parent's container walk goes through
`Node._getMinContentForParent`, which applies the CSS escape hatches:

- `overflow != visible` on the child → returns `0` (CSS §4.5
  container-side rule: scroll/hidden children can clip on parent's main
  axis, so their min-content from the parent's POV is 0).
- Explicit `minWidth: 0` / `minHeight: 0` in points → returns `0`
  (canonical CSS opt-out from the auto-min floor).
- Explicit definite size (`width`/`height` in points) → returns that
  size (a Box with `width: 10` reports min-content = 10 to its parent
  even if its content min is smaller).

Cached per-node in two slots (`_minContentRow`, `_minContentCol`).
Uses `-1` as the invalidation sentinel (NOT `NaN` — `Object.is(NaN, NaN)`
would cause false cache hits, same reason `_lc0`/`_lc1` use `-1`).
Cleared in `markDirty()` alongside the existing measure + layout caches;
since style setters and `insertChild`/`removeChild` all funnel through
`markDirty`, every invalidation path is covered.

`layout-zero.ts` adds the **CSS §4.5 specified-size suggestion** as a
cap on top of the recursive content-min:

```ts
contentMinSize = child.getMinContent(direction, containingBlock)
// Cap: auto-min = min(content-min, specified-size, ...)
//   specified-size = flex-basis (if definite) else main-axis size
let specifiedSize = Infinity
if (childStyle.flexBasis.unit === C.UNIT_POINT) {
  specifiedSize = childStyle.flexBasis.value
} else if (childStyle.flexBasis.unit === C.UNIT_AUTO) {
  // fall through to width/height when flex-basis is auto
  ...
}
if (specifiedSize !== Infinity) {
  contentMinSize = Math.min(contentMinSize, specifiedSize)
}
```

This is what makes `flexBasis: 0` opt-out work correctly. Without the
cap, a Fill-style child (clipped 500-char repeated text inside
`flexGrow: 1, flexBasis: 0`) would report content-min = 500 and force
its row to expand past the parent. The cap restores the
"flexBasis: 0 means I carry no inherent main-axis size" contract.

Aspect-ratio + definite cross-axis is folded in via the transferred-size
suggestion clamp (a separate Math.min after the specified-size cap).

### `UNIT_AUTO` semantics outside flex-item-main

`resolveValue` returns 0 for `UNIT_AUTO` (default branch). For non-flex-item-main
paths (root/cross-axis/measureNode min-clamp), this is correct CSS behavior —
the auto-rule applies only to flex items on their main axis.

**Defaults preset**: `createFlexily({ defaults: "css" | "yoga" })` and
`Node.create({ defaults })` toggle `flexShrink`/`alignContent`. `DEFAULT_PRESET`
constant is currently `"yoga"`; bead `km-silvery.flexshrink-default` tracks the
flip to `"css"` for multi-target consumers. Closure-captured per engine — no
module state. See `defaults.ts`.

## Style and Value System

### Value Type

```typescript
interface Value {
  value: number
  unit: number
}
// unit: UNIT_UNDEFINED(0), UNIT_POINT(1), UNIT_PERCENT(2), UNIT_AUTO(3)
```

### Style Storage

Edge-based properties use 6-element arrays: `[left, top, right, bottom, start, end]`

- Physical edges: indices 0-3
- Logical edges: indices 4-5 (resolved at layout time based on direction)
- Logical takes precedence over physical when both are set

Border widths are plain numbers (always points). Logical border slots use `NaN` as "not set" sentinel.

### Default Style

```typescript
flexDirection: ROW         // CSS default (diverges from Yoga's COLUMN)
flexShrink: 0              // CSS default is 1
alignItems: STRETCH        // Same as CSS
flexBasis: AUTO            // Same as CSS
width/height: AUTO         // Same as CSS
positionType: RELATIVE     // Same as CSS
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Where Flexily Wins

- **Node creation**: ~8x cheaper than Yoga (no WASM boundary crossing)
- **Initial layout**: 1.5-2.5x faster (JS node creation dominates)
- **No-change re-layout**: 5.5x faster (fingerprint cache, 27ns regardless of tree size)
- **Bundle size**: 2.5x smaller (3.4x without `debug` dep)

### Where Yoga Wins

- **Incremental re-layout** (dirty leaf in existing tree): 2.8-3.4x faster (WASM per-node computation is faster)
- **Deep nesting** (15+ levels): Yoga's advantage increases with depth

### For TUI Use Cases

The no-change case dominates (cursor movement, selection, scrolling). Flexily's fingerprint cache makes this essentially free. This is the key differentiator.

## Common Pitfalls

### Modifying layout-zero.ts

1. **Always benchmark** after any change (see instructions below)
2. **Don't allocate in the hot path** -- no `new`, no object literals, no array construction inside `layoutNode()` or `distributeFlexSpaceForLine()`
3. **NaN semantics are load-bearing** -- `NaN` means "unconstrained/auto". Use `Number.isNaN()` checks, not `=== NaN`. Use `Object.is()` for equality comparison.
4. **Edge-based rounding must use absolute coordinates** -- rounding relative positions creates gaps
5. **Save/restore `layout.width`/`layout.height` around `measureNode`** -- it overwrites those fields with intrinsic measurements

### Modifying node-zero.ts

1. **markDirty() always clears caches** -- even if node is already dirty, because child content may have changed
2. **Cache invalidation uses `-1` sentinel, not `NaN`** -- because `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` is true, NaN would cause false cache hits
3. **Lazy allocation for cache entries** -- `_m0` through `_m3` and `_lc0`/`_lc1` are `undefined` until first use

### Modifying caching/fingerprinting

1. **Run the re-layout fuzz tests**: `bun test tests/relayout-consistency.test.ts` (1200+ tests)
2. **Run mutation testing**: `bun scripts/mutation-test.ts` to verify fuzz suite catches deliberate cache mutations
3. The differential oracle (`expectRelayoutMatchesFresh`) is the primary correctness tool: build tree -> layout -> dirty -> re-layout -> compare against fresh layout

### Adding features

1. Update `createDefaultStyle()` in `types.ts` with correct default
2. Add setter/getter to `Node` class (call `markDirty()` in setters)
3. Handle in `layoutNode()` (and `measureNode()` if it affects sizing)
4. Add to Yoga compatibility tests if corresponding Yoga behavior exists
5. Verify re-layout fuzz tests still pass

## Benchmarking Protocol

After ANY change to `layout-zero.ts` or `node-zero.ts`:

```bash
# 1. Check CPU load -- no heavy processes running
uptime | sed 's/.*load average[s]*: //' && (nproc 2>/dev/null || sysctl -n hw.ncpu)

# 2. Run benchmark (from the repo root)
# BOTH files: the warmup benchmark has zero measureFunc leaves and is blind to
# text-only paths. Establish the harness floor with a null control (two
# byte-identical copies) before believing any delta — under fleet load it has
# reported +3.66% from identical code.
bun bench bench/yoga-compare-warmup.bench.ts bench/yoga-compare-rich.bench.ts

# 3. Compare against baseline:
#    Flexily should be ~2x Yoga for flat trees
#    Flexily should be ~2.3x Yoga for shallow deep trees
#    No-change re-layout should be ~5.5x Yoga

# 4. If you changed source, rebuild:
bun run build
```

**Acceptable impact:**

- Regressions < 5% for minor features
- No regressions for refactoring (must be neutral or faster)
- Document any trade-offs

The fuzz tests are the most important layer. They've caught 3 distinct caching bugs that all single-pass tests missed.

## Lessons from Past Sessions

### Three Caching Bugs (2026-02-10)

All 524 Flexily tests passed. The TUI showed visual corruption (text bleeding past card borders) only during re-layout of partially-dirty trees. Root cause: zero tests exercised `calculateLayout()` twice on the same tree.

**Bug 1: measureNode corruption** — `measureNode()` overwrote `layout.width/height` on clean nodes as a side effect. The fingerprint check then skipped the clean node, preserving corrupted values. Fix: save/restore `layout.width/height` around `measureNode` calls.

**Bug 2: NaN cache sentinel** — `resetLayoutCache()` used `NaN` to invalidate entries. But `NaN` is a legitimate "unconstrained" query value, and `Object.is(NaN, NaN) === true` caused false cache hits. Fix: use `-1` as the invalidation sentinel (non-negative field, so `-1` is outside the legitimate domain).

**Bug 3: Fingerprint mismatch** — Auto-sized children receive `NaN` as availableWidth. When the parent's flex distribution changed between passes (shrinkage at 60px vs no shrinkage at 80px), the `NaN===NaN` fingerprint matched even though the parent would override the child's width differently. Fix: ensure fingerprint captures all inputs that affect output, including parent-side overrides.

All three bugs were found by a **differential oracle**: build tree → layout → mark dirty → re-layout → compare against fresh layout. Fresh layout is trivially correct (no caching involved). Any difference is a bug.

### Performance Optimization (2026-02-10)

Baseline measurements vs Yoga:

- **Flat trees**: Flexily ~2x faster (node creation dominates — no WASM boundary)
- **Shallow deep trees**: Flexily ~2.3x faster
- **No-change re-layout**: Flexily ~5.5x faster (fingerprint cache, ~27ns)
- **FlexWrap**: Yoga 1.77x faster (Flexily's multi-line allocation is the weak spot)
- **Incremental dirty leaf**: Yoga 2.8-3.4x faster (WASM per-node computation is faster)

Key takeaway: For TUI use cases, the no-change case dominates (cursor movement, selection, scrolling). Flexily's fingerprint cache makes this essentially free.

## Common Blind Paths

| Blind Path                                   | Why It Doesn't Work                                                        | What to Do Instead                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Allocating in the hot path                   | GC pauses cause visible jank in interactive TUIs                           | Use FlexInfo mutation, pre-allocated arrays, `-1` sentinels                       |
| Using `NaN` as invalidation sentinel         | `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` is `true` — causes false cache hits                  | Use `-1` for non-negative fields                                                  |
| Rounding relative positions                  | Creates pixel gaps between adjacent elements                               | Round absolute edge positions, derive sizes as differences                        |
| Single-pass tests for caching code           | Zero coverage of re-layout paths; 524 tests can pass with 3 caching bugs   | Use differential oracle: fresh layout vs re-layout                                |
| Modifying `measureNode` without save/restore | `measureNode` overwrites `layout.width/height` as a side effect            | Always save/restore around `measureNode` calls                                    |
| Assuming dirty propagation stops early       | Even if node is already dirty, child changes may invalidate cached results | Always clear caches when `markDirty()` is called, even on already-dirty ancestors |
| Testing with simple flat trees               | Complex bugs appear with nesting, auto-sizing, flex distribution changes   | Use fuzz testing with random tree structures and dirty subsets                    |

## Effective Strategies (Priority Order)

1. **Run the re-layout fuzz suite** — `bun test tests/relayout-consistency.test.ts` (1200+ tests). If it passes, caching logic is correct for known patterns. If a seed fails, use `-t "seed=N"` to isolate.

2. **Differential oracle testing** — Build tree → layout → dirty → re-layout → compare against fresh layout. Don't hardcode expected values. `expectRelayoutMatchesFresh()` in `testing.ts` does this automatically.

3. **Mutation testing** — `bun scripts/mutation-test.ts` verifies the fuzz suite catches deliberate cache mutations. Run after modifying cache/fingerprint logic to ensure test coverage is sufficient.

4. **Benchmark before and after** — Any change to `layout-zero.ts` or `node-zero.ts` requires benchmark comparison. No regressions for refactoring; <5% for features.

5. **Check NaN semantics** — Whenever you see a comparison, ask: "What if this value is NaN?" Use `Object.is()` for equality, `Number.isNaN()` for checks, never `=== NaN`.

6. **Targeted test mirroring real structure** — If fuzz doesn't find it, create a test that mirrors the exact component structure from the TUI (card structure, scroll containers, nested flex).
